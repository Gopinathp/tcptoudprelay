# tcptoudprelay


This is developed in order to address some bugs with Cellphone towers not able to handle UDP routing correctly. 
The idea here is that the data is transferred to this micro-service on TCP and data is upstreamed to a proper UDP server and response relayed back on TCP to the mobile client.
